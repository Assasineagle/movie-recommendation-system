# *Movie Recommender System*

This project implements a Movie Recommender System using a collaborative filtering approach. The system suggests movies to users based on their historical preferences or interactions. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model building, and recommendations generation.

## *Features*

Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on user-item interactions using collaborative filtering techniques.
User-Based Recommendations: Suggests movies to a user based on preferences of similar users.
Movie-Based Recommendations: Recommends similar movies based on user ratings.
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the movie dataset for analysis.
Scalable: The system can scale to larger datasets and support many users/movies.

## *Technologies Used*

### Python: The core programming language used.
### Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
### NumPy: For numerical computations.
### scikit-learn: For building recommendation models and evaluation.
### Jupyter Notebook: Used for coding and documenting the project.

## *Usage*

### Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommender-system.git
cd movie-recommender-system

### Install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook movie_recommender_system.ipynb

### Run the cells in the notebook to preprocess data, build the model, and get recommendations.


## Data Loading: The movie dataset is loaded and prepared for use.
Model Building: A collaborative filtering algorithm is applied to predict user ratings for movies.
Recommendations: Based on the model's predictions, the system generates personalized recommendations for users.
