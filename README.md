# **Movie Recommender System**

This project implements a **Movie Recommender System** using collaborative filtering techniques to suggest movies based on user preferences.

## **Project Steps**

1. **Data Loading**: Load movie and user rating data for analysis.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and filter unnecessary data.
3. **Data Analysis**: Explore the dataset by analyzing rating distributions and movie popularity.
4. **Data Preprocessing**: Create a user-item matrix to prepare data for model building.
5. **Model Building**: Implement collaborative filtering using user-based or item-based approaches. Matrix Factorization (SVD) is also used.
6. **Recommendations**: Generate personalized movie recommendations based on similar users or movies.
7. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE and Precision/Recall.
8. **Conclusion**: Review and fine-tune the model for better performance.
